## Isolator

This is the source code to Isolator version 4.9, a menu bar application for Mac OS X
that helps you concentrate. For more information about Isolator, see 
[here](http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/)

*Note: The methods that Isolator uses have not been ported by Apple for 64-bit applications. Since mac OS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications, Isolator will no longer work.*
